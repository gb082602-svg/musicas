Things fall apart and time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl, you showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go

She was crying on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer
Until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me
Shouldn't I?

But I see her
In the back of my mind
All the time
Like a fever
Like I'm burning alive like a sign
Did I cross the line?
Mmm, mmm

Well, good things don't last
And life moves so fast
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be more different from me
Happy and free in leather

And I know that you love me (you love me)
You don't need to remind me (remind me)
Wanna put it all behind me
But, baby

I see her
In the back of my mind (back of my mind)
All the time (all the time)
Feels like a fever (like a fever)
Like I'm burning alive (burning alive) like a sign
Did I cross the line? (Cross the line), ooh

(You say no one knows you so well)
(But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt)
(Valentine's Day, crying in the hotel)
(I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself)

And I wonder
Do you see her
In the back of your mind?
In my eyes?

You say no one knows you so well
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, crying in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
