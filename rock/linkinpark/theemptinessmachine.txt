Your blades are sharpened with precision
Flashing your favorite point of view
I know you're waiting in the distance
Just like you always do, just like you always do
Already pulling me in, already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends
I let you cut me open, just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hoping for what I won't receive
Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine
The emptiness machine
Going around like a revolver
It's been decided how we lose
'Cause there's a fire under the altar
I keep on lying to, I keep on lying to
Already pulling me in, already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends
I let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hoping for what I won't receive
Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine
I only wanted to be part of something
I only wanted to be part of, part of
I only wanted to be part of something
I only wanted to be part of, part of
I only wanted to be part of something
I only wanted to be part
I let you cut me open, just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hoping, so fucking naive
Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine
The emptiness machine (I only wanted to be part of something)
The emptiness machine (I only wanted to be part of)
The emptiness machine
